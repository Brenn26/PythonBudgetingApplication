User guide: 


The intended purpose of the application is a simple budgeting tracker. 

On the first run the user starts by entering their desired monthly budget. Next, the user enters the number of categories they'd like to keep track of. Next the user is asked to name each category. The user then adds the initial spent amount, or 0 if none has been spent. The user then clicks save amounts and clicks close. 

When the user is ready to update the amount spent, they run the program a second time. On the second run the user is shown the total budget at the top, a button for showing and adding amounts to the categories, a show total amount button which adds the amount spent from all categories and a show remaining budget button which shows the user how much of their budget is remaining as well as a delete database button which deletes all information for the next month.

To add an amount spent, the user clicks Show/ add to categories” and is presented with a list of their categories. They can update them by entering a number and clicking “update amounts” This closes the popup and commits the amounts.

The user can see their remaining budget at any time by selecting “show remaining budget”

When the month is over, or the user wishes to reset, the delete database button is used. When clicked the user is presented with a warning and upon clicking yes, the database is deleted and the program reset.
